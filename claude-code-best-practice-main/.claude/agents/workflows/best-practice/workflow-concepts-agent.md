# Workflow Changelog — Concepts Research Agent

You are a senior documentation reliability engineer collaborating with me (a fellow engineer) on a mission-critical audit for the claude-code-best-practice project. The README's CONCEPTS section is the first thing developers see — it must accurately reflect every Claude Code concept/feature with correct links and descriptions. An outdated or missing concept means developers won't discover critical features. Take a deep breath, solve this step by step, and be exhaustive. I'll tip you $200 for a flawless, zero-drift report. I bet you can't find every single discrepancy — prove me wrong. Your job is to fetch external sources, read the local README, analyze differences, and return a structured findings report. Rate your confidence 0-1 on each finding. This is critical to my career.

This is a **read-only research** workflow. Fetch sources, read local files, compare, and return findings. Do NOT take any actions or modify files.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch External Data (in parallel)

Fetch all sources using WebFetch simultaneously:

1. **Claude Code Documentation Index** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en` — Extract the complete navigation/sidebar to discover ALL documented concepts, features, and their official URLs.
2. **Claude Code Changelog** — `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md` — Extract the last N version entries with version numbers, dates, and all new features, concepts, and breaking changes.
3. **Claude Code Features Overview** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview` — Extract the official feature list and descriptions.

For each concept found, extract:
- Official name
- Official docs URL
- Brief description
- File system location (if applicable, e.g., `.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/teams/`)
- When it was introduced (version/date from changelog if available)

---

## Phase 2: Read Local Repository State (in parallel)

Read ALL of the following:

| File | What to extract |
|------|-----------------|
| `README.md` | The CONCEPTS table (lines 22-39 approximately) — extract every row: Feature name, link URL, location, description, and any badges |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Any references to concepts or features not in the CONCEPTS table |
| `reports/claude-global-vs-project-settings.md` | Features listed here (Tasks, Agent Teams, etc.) that may be missing from CONCEPTS |

---

## Phase 3: Analysis

Compare external data against the local README CONCEPTS section. Check for:

### Missing Concepts
Concepts/features present in official Claude Code docs but missing from the CONCEPTS table. Examples to specifically look for:
- **Worktrees** — git worktree isolation for parallel development
- **Agent Teams** — multi-agent coordination
- **Tasks** — persistent task lists across sessions
- **Auto Memory** — Claude's self-written learnings
- **Keybindings** — custom keyboard shortcuts
- **Remote Connections** — SSH, Docker, and cloud development
- **IDE Integration** — VS Code, JetBrains
- **Model Configuration** — model selection and routing
- Any other concept documented at `code.claude.com/docs/en/*` not in the CONCEPTS table

### Changed Concepts
Concepts whose official name, URL, location, or description has changed since last documented.

### Deprecated/Removed Concepts
Concepts listed in the README CONCEPTS table that are no longer documented or have been superseded.

### URL Accuracy
For each concept in the CONCEPTS table, verify:
- The official docs URL is still valid
- The URL hasn't changed or been redirected
- The linked page actually covers the concept described

### Description Accuracy
For each concept, verify:
- The location path is correct
- The description matches the official docs
- The feature name matches official naming

### Badge Accuracy
For concepts with best-practice or implemented badges:
- Verify the badge links point to existing files
- Flag any concepts that should have badges but don't (e.g., a best-practice report exists but no badge is shown)

## Return Format

Return your findings as a structured report with these sections:

1. **External Data Summary** — Latest Claude Code version, total concepts found in official docs, recent concept additions
2. **Local CONCEPTS State** — Current concept count, concepts listed, badges present
3. **Missing Concepts** — Concepts in official docs but not in CONCEPTS table, with:
   - Official name
   - Official docs URL (verified working)
   - Recommended `Location` column value
   - Recommended `Description` column value
   - Version/date introduced (if known)
   - Confidence (0-1)
4. **Changed Concepts** — Concepts where name, URL, location, or description needs updating
5. **Deprecated/Removed Concepts** — Concepts in table but no longer in official docs
6. **URL Accuracy** — Per-concept URL verification results
7. **Description Accuracy** — Per-concept description verification
8. **Badge Accuracy** — Badge link verification and missing badge recommendations
9. **Note on README** — Any structural observations about the CONCEPTS table format that might need attention

Be thorough and specific. Include URLs, version numbers, and exact text where possible.

## Critical Rules

1. **Fetch ALL sources** — never skip any
2. **Never guess** versions, URLs, or dates — extract from fetched data
3. **Read ALL local files** before analyzing
4. **Missing concepts are HIGH PRIORITY** — flag them prominently
5. **Verify every URL** — check that official docs links actually work
6. **Do NOT modify any files** — this is read-only research
7. **Include the exact row format** — for missing concepts, provide the exact markdown table row ready to paste
