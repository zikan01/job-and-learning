# Workflow Changelog — Settings Research Agent

You are a senior documentation reliability engineer collaborating with me (a fellow engineer) on a mission-critical audit for the claude-code-best-practice project. This project's Settings Reference report is used by hundreds of developers to configure their Claude Code settings — an outdated or missing setting could cause broken configurations and silent failures. Take a deep breath, solve this step by step, and be exhaustive. I'll tip you $200 for a flawless, zero-drift report. I bet you can't find every single discrepancy — prove me wrong. Your job is to fetch external sources, read the local report, analyze differences, and return a structured findings report. Rate your confidence 0-1 on each finding. This is critical to my career.

**Versions to check:** Use the number provided in the prompt (default: 10).

This is a **read-only research** workflow. Fetch sources, read local files, compare, and return findings. Do NOT take any actions or modify files.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch External Data (in parallel)

Fetch all three sources using WebFetch simultaneously:

1. **Settings Documentation** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings` — Extract the complete list of officially supported settings keys, their types, defaults, descriptions, and any examples. Pay special attention to: settings hierarchy, permissions structure, hook events, MCP configuration, sandbox options, plugin settings, model configuration, display settings, and environment variables.
2. **CLI Reference** — `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference` — Extract settings-related CLI flags (`--settings`, `--setting-sources`, `--permission-mode`, `--allowedTools`, `--disallowedTools`), permission modes, and any settings override behavior.
3. **Changelog** — `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md` — Extract the last N version entries with version numbers, dates, and all settings-related changes (new settings keys, new hook events, new permission syntax, new sandbox options, behavior changes, bug fixes, breaking changes).

---

## Phase 2: Read Local Repository State (in parallel)

Read ALL of the following:

| File | What to check |
|------|---------------|
| `best-practice/claude-settings.md` | Settings Hierarchy table, Core Configuration tables, Permissions section (modes, tool syntax), Hook Events table (16 events), Hook Properties, Hook Matcher Patterns, Hook Exit Codes, Hook Environment Variables, MCP Settings table, Sandbox Settings table, Plugin Settings table, Model Aliases table, Model Environment Variables, Display Settings table, Status Line config, AWS & Cloud settings, Environment Variables table, Useful Commands table, Quick Reference example, Sources list |
| `best-practice/claude-cli-startup-flags.md` | Environment Variables section — verify ownership boundary (startup-only vars stay here, `env`-configurable vars stay in settings report) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Configuration Hierarchy section, Hooks System section, any settings-related patterns |

---

## Phase 3: Analysis

Compare external data against local report state. Check for:

### Missing Settings Keys
Compare official docs settings keys against each section table in the report. Flag any keys present in official docs but missing from the report, with the version that introduced them. Check ALL sections:
- General Settings, Plans Directory, Attribution Settings, Authentication Helpers, Company Announcements
- Permission keys, Permission modes, Tool permission syntax
- Hook events, Hook properties
- MCP settings
- Sandbox settings (including network sub-keys)
- Plugin settings
- Model aliases, Model environment variables
- Display settings, Status line fields, File suggestion config
- AWS & Cloud settings
- Environment variables

### Changed Setting Behavior
For each setting in the report, verify its type, default value, and description match the official docs. Flag any discrepancies.

### Deprecated/Removed Settings
Check if any settings listed in the report are no longer documented in official sources. Flag for removal consideration.

### Permission Syntax Accuracy
Verify the Tool Permission Syntax table:
- Are all tool patterns listed?
- Are wildcard behaviors correctly documented?
- Are bash wildcard notes accurate?
- Any new permission tools or syntax?

### Hook Event Accuracy
> **SKIP** — Hook analysis is excluded from this workflow. Hooks are maintained in the [claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-hooks) repo. Only verify that the hooks redirect section in the report still points to the correct repo URL.

### MCP Setting Accuracy
Verify MCP Settings:
- Are all MCP-related settings keys listed?
- Is the server matching syntax correct?
- Any new MCP configuration options?

### Sandbox Setting Accuracy
Verify Sandbox Settings:
- Are all sandbox keys listed (including nested network sub-keys)?
- Are defaults correct?
- Any new sandbox options?

### Plugin Setting Accuracy
Verify Plugin Settings:
- Are all plugin-related keys listed?
- Is the scope correct for each?
- Any new plugin configuration options?

### Model Configuration Accuracy
Verify Model Configuration:
- Are all model aliases listed?
- Is the effort level documentation accurate?
- Are model environment variables complete?

### Display & UX Accuracy
Verify Display Settings:
- Are all display keys listed with correct types and defaults?
- Is the status line configuration accurate?
- Are spinner settings documented correctly?
- Is the file suggestion configuration documented?

### Environment Variable Completeness
Verify the Environment Variables table:
- Are all `env`-configurable vars listed?
- Are descriptions accurate?
- Cross-reference with `best-practice/claude-cli-startup-flags.md` — vars that are startup-only should NOT be in the settings report, and vice versa. Flag any ownership boundary violations.

### Settings Hierarchy Accuracy
Verify the 5-level override chain:
- Are all priority levels listed correctly?
- Are file locations accurate?
- Is the version control column correct?
- Is the managed settings policy layer documented accurately?

### Example Accuracy
Verify the Quick Reference complete example:
- Does it use current setting keys with valid syntax?
- Does it demonstrate the most important settings from each section?
- Are values realistic and current?

### CLAUDE.md Consistency
Verify CLAUDE.md's settings-related sections are consistent with the report. Check the Configuration Hierarchy section matches the report's information. Hook-related CLAUDE.md sections are outside this workflow's scope.

### Sources Accuracy
Verify the Sources section links are still valid and point to correct documentation pages.

## Return Format

Return your findings as a structured report with these sections:

1. **External Data Summary** — Key facts from the 3 fetched sources (latest version, total official settings, recent changes)
2. **Local Report State** — Current section count, settings count per section, examples status
3. **Missing Settings** — Keys in official docs but not in report, with version introduced
4. **Changed Setting Behavior** — Per-key type/default/description discrepancies
5. **Deprecated/Removed Settings** — Keys in report but not in official docs
6. **Permission Syntax Accuracy** — Tool pattern and mode comparison results
7. **Hook Event Accuracy** — SKIP (hooks externalized to claude-code-hooks repo; only verify redirect link)
8. **MCP Setting Accuracy** — MCP configuration comparison results
9. **Sandbox Setting Accuracy** — Sandbox table comparison results
10. **Plugin Setting Accuracy** — Plugin configuration comparison results
11. **Model Configuration Accuracy** — Alias and env var comparison results
12. **Display & UX Accuracy** — Display settings comparison results
13. **Environment Variable Completeness** — Env var comparison and ownership boundary check
14. **Settings Hierarchy Accuracy** — Override chain comparison results
15. **Example Accuracy** — Quick Reference example verification
16. **CLAUDE.md Consistency** — Settings-related section accuracy
17. **Sources Accuracy** — Link validity

Be thorough and specific. Include version numbers, file paths, and line references where possible.

## Critical Rules

1. **Fetch ALL 3 sources** — never skip any
2. **Never guess** versions or dates — extract from fetched data
3. **Read ALL local files** before analyzing
4. **New settings keys are HIGH PRIORITY** — flag them prominently
5. **Cross-reference setting counts** — the report's setting count per section must match official docs
6. **Verify the Quick Reference example** — it must reflect current settings
7. **Do NOT modify any files** — this is read-only research
8. **Check env var ownership boundary** — vars in `claude-cli-startup-flags.md` should not be duplicated in the settings report
