## 1/ Introducing Code Review

New in Claude Code: **Code Review**. A team of agents runs a deep review on every PR.

- Built for Anthropic's own team first — code output per engineer is up **200% this year**, and reviews were the bottleneck
- Boris has been using it for a few weeks and found it catches many real bugs he would not have noticed otherwise
- When a PR opens, Claude dispatches a team of agents to hunt for bugs

## 2/ Test Time Compute & Multiple Context Windows

Roughly, the more tokens you throw at a coding problem, the better the result. Boris calls this **test time compute**.

- Using **separate context windows** makes the result even better — this is what makes subagents work, and why one agent can cause bugs and another (using the same exact model) can find them
- Similar to engineering teams: if Boris causes a bug, his coworker reviewing the code might find it more reliably than he can
- In the limit, agents will probably write perfect bug-free code — until then, **multiple uncorrelated context windows** tends to be a good approach
